V.9.0 Code Snippet:

Logging Configuration: Configuring logging with basicConfig is a good practice for handling errors. However, as you rightly mentioned, specifying the log file or destination can be beneficial in production applications. Logging to a file allows for easier error analysis and monitoring.

Global Variables: While global variables like saved_word_list can work in a simple application, they might not be the best choice for larger or more complex programs. Encapsulating related data and functions in a class or using more structured approaches can improve code modularity and maintainability.

Redundant Iteration: The presence of multiple iterations (controlled by num_iterations) without clear explanation or purpose can lead to confusion. It's important to document the reasoning behind multiple iterations or consider if they are necessary for the intended functionality.

Update of paragraphs List: You correctly noted that the code doesn't reset the processed_paragraphs list in each iteration. This could result in the accumulation of processed paragraphs from previous iterations, potentially leading to unexpected behavior. Proper initialization and clearing of data structures are essential.

V.9.9 Code Snippet:

Simplified Processing Logic: Simplifying the processing logic by removing unnecessary iterations is a significant improvement. It makes the code cleaner, more efficient, and easier to understand.

Error Handling: The second snippet enhances the user experience by using message boxes for error handling. This provides clear and user-friendly feedback in case of issues, improving the overall usability of the application.

Global Variables: The reduction in the use of global variables in the second snippet is generally a positive change. It promotes better code organization and readability.
