V.11.0 Code Snippet:

Global Variables: While the use of global variables like saved_word_list is suitable for a simple application, it may not be ideal for larger and more complex programs. Encapsulating such variables within classes or structures can enhance code organization and maintainability.

Redundant Iterations: The presence of multiple iterations without clear documentation or explanation can lead to code complexity and confusion. Documenting the rationale for these iterations or simplifying the logic, if unnecessary, would improve code clarity.

Working Directory: Using global variables for configuration data, such as initial_working_directory, is not a recommended practice. It's better to pass such information as parameters or use a configuration file to provide flexibility and maintainability.

V.11.9 Code Snippet:

Simplified Processing Logic: The second code snippet simplifies the document processing logic by eliminating unnecessary iterations, resulting in cleaner and more straightforward code. This simplification improves code readability and maintainability.

Error Handling: The improved error handling using message boxes enhances the user experience by providing clear and user-friendly feedback when issues occur during document processing.

Global Variables: Reducing the use of global variables in the second snippet is a positive change that contributes to better code organization and readability.

User Interface: The introduction of a more organized user interface with action buttons, such as updating, saving, and loading the word list, enhances user interaction and usability.

Regular Expressions: The use of regular expressions to clean up extra brackets in the processed text is a valuable addition. It ensures that the processed text adheres to the desired format, which is a good practice for data consistency.
