Code Snippet V.13.0:

Filename Sanitization: Handling special characters in filenames is crucial for robust file operations. The current regular expression approach may not cover all possible special characters. Consider using a library or built-in function specifically designed for filename sanitization to ensure all edge cases are handled.

Folder Name Sanitization: Similar to filenames, handling special characters in folder names should also be addressed using a robust method.

Missing Processing Logic: The code is designed for processing Markdown files into Word documents, but the actual conversion from Markdown to HTML and subsequent HTML content processing is not implemented. The placeholder comment for processing HTML content needs to be replaced with the actual logic to fulfill the intended functionality.

Code Snippet V.13.9:

Filename Sanitization: Handling special characters in filenames is critical in this code snippet as well. A more robust method for sanitizing filenames is needed.

Global Variable: The use of a global variable (selected_document) for storing the selected document's path can lead to issues as the application grows. A better approach would be to return the selected document path from the select_document function.

Error Handling: There's no error handling for cases where the user cancels the file dialog when selecting a Word document. You should implement error handling to handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by displaying a message to inform the user.

Separate Processing Functions: Combining processing for a single Word document and processing for a folder into a single function may make the application less intuitive. Consider providing separate buttons or options for processing a single document and processing a folder to enhance user experience.

Missing Processing Logic: As in the first snippet, the Markdown to HTML conversion and HTML content processing logic is missing in this snippet as well. The actual logic for these steps needs to be implemented to achieve the desired functionality.
