Code V.5.0 and V.5.9:

Usage of output_filename: You correctly noted that the output_filename is used both for the output filename and the result filename. This should be corrected to ensure that the result is saved with the intended filename. You can create a separate variable for the result filename to avoid confusion.

Broad Exception Handling: Expanding the exception handling to catch a broader range of exceptions, such as IOError or Exception, is a good practice. It allows the code to handle various file-related issues more gracefully.

os.path.join for File Paths: Constructing file paths correctly using os.path.join is crucial for cross-platform compatibility. This change should be made to ensure that file paths work as expected on different operating systems.

Logging for Errors: Replacing the print statement inside the process_word_document function with logging.error is consistent with the error handling approach used in the rest of the code. It helps maintain a uniform error reporting style.

Testing for Adding and Removing Words: The code for adding and removing words from the saved word list should be thoroughly tested to ensure it functions correctly in real-world scenarios. This is especially important if these operations are critical to the application's functionality.
