V.12.0 Code Snippet:

Missing Import: The use of the process_html_content function without its implementation or import statement is a critical issue. You should either provide the implementation for this function or remove the call if it's not needed.

Missing BeautifulSoup Import: If you intend to use BeautifulSoup for HTML processing, you need to add an import statement for BeautifulSoup at the beginning of your script. For example, you can include: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup.

Undefined change_working_directory Function: The code mentions a change_working_directory function but doesn't provide its implementation. Ensure that this function is defined elsewhere in your code or provide its implementation.

Undefined process_html_files_in_folder Function: The process_html_files_in_folder function is defined but not called anywhere in the code. If you intend to use this function, you should call it from an appropriate location in your code.

Indentation Issue: In the process_html_files_in_folder function, the return processed_html line is not indented correctly. It should be aligned with the try block to avoid a syntax error.

V.12.9 Code Snippet:

Missing Import for Markdown: You mentioned using the markdown library, but there is no import statement for it. Include import markdown at the beginning of your script to use this library.

Undefined duplicate_folder Function: The code mentions a duplicate_folder function but doesn't provide its implementation. Ensure that this function is defined elsewhere in your code or provide its implementation.

Missing Markdown to HTML Conversion Logic: In the process_folder function, you mention processing Markdown files and converting them to HTML, but the code does not include the conversion logic. You should add the logic to convert Markdown to HTML, potentially using the markdown library you imported.

Indentation Issue: In the process_folder function, the messagebox.showinfo call is not indented correctly. It should be aligned with the try block for proper indentation.

Missing GUI Event Binding: The process_folder_dialog function is defined to open a folder selection dialog and process the selected folder, but it is not linked to any button or event in the GUI. You should add a button in your GUI and bind an event to call this function.

Initial Working Directory Hardcoding: The initial working directory is hardcoded in the variable initial_working_directory. Consider making this more flexible or user-configurable, especially if you want users to select the initial working directory.
