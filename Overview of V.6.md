Code Snippet V.6.0 and V.6.9:

Usage of output_filename: Correct the usage of the output_filename variable to ensure that it's used appropriately for both the output filename and the result filename. This will prevent any unintended overwriting.

Broad Exception Handling: Improve exception handling by catching a broader range of exceptions, such as Exception or IOError, to handle various potential file-related issues more gracefully.

Logging for Errors: Replace the print statement inside the process_word_document function with logging.error to maintain consistency in error reporting and to make the code more maintainable.

Testing for Adding and Removing Words: Conduct thorough testing of the code responsible for adding and removing words from the saved_word_list. Comprehensive testing will ensure that these operations work correctly in real-world sc
