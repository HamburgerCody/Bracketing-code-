V.4.0 Code Snippet:

GUI Integration: Introducing a GUI using the tkinter library provides a more user-friendly way to input data and control the processing of Word documents. It's a good choice for creating interactive applications.

Function Definitions: Defining separate functions for processing the document and updating the word list is a good practice for code organization and readability.

Usage of last_used_word_list: The code updates the last_used_word_list variable, but it's not apparent how this updated word list is used elsewhere in the code. It's essential to ensure that any changes to data are used correctly in the application.

Informative Messages: The use of message boxes to provide informative messages for success and failure is a good practice for user interaction. It helps users understand the outcome of their actions.

V.4.9 Code Snippet:

Main Application Window: Creating a main application window with widgets like labels, text boxes, and buttons is a common approach for building GUI applications. This provides a structured and visually appealing interface.

Function Ordering: The order of function definitions and widget creation is important in tkinter applications. Functions that reference widgets should be defined after those widgets are created to avoid referencing issues.

Usage of Updated Word List: The code mentions an update_word_list function, but it's not clear how the updated word list is used in the application. It's crucial to ensure that the updated data is utilized correctly in the processing logic.

Message Boxes: The use of the messagebox module to display informative messages is a standard practice for providing feedback to the user in GUI applications.
